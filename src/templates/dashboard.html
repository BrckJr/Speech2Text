    <h2>Audio Recording</h2>
    <p>
        To start your training, press the start button to begin recording. It may take one or two seconds
        until your microphone is activated. To pause the recording, press the pause button.
        Once you finished with the recording, press the stop button and insert
        a filename to save the recording and start the analysis. Please be aware that once you stopped the
        recording, you cannot resume it again. Depending on the length of the recording, it may take a few moments
        to store the audio file and analyze its content.

    <p>
        In presentations, it‚Äôs often the way you speak that determines whether your audience finds the content engaging or not.
        That‚Äôs why your recording is analyzed based on the following clear and measurable aspects:
    </p>
    <ol class="analytics-list">
        <li> <p_bf>General Information:</p_bf> This includes an AI generated headline for your speech, the language of your
            recording as well as the length and word count in your recording.
        </li>
        <li><p_bf>Summary of the Speech:</p_bf>  AI generated summary of your speech. If the AI model captures the essence
            of your speech, it is also likely that your audience may capture it.
        </li>
        <li><p_bf>Speech Rate:</p_bf>  The graph shows your speech rate over time for your whole recording. The speech rate
            is measured in words per minute. There are also upper and lower bounds marked in the graph,
            giving you an orientation in which bounds your speech rate should be to avoid being too slow or too fast.
        </li>
        <li><p_bf>Pitch Analysis:</p_bf>  The graph shows the pitch you have during your speech. Usually, it is a good sign to have
            high amplitude of your pitch throughout the speech as this means you are varying in your pitch.
            In contrast, boring speeches usually have a small amplitude.
        </li>
        <li><p_bf>Energy Analysis:</p_bf>  The graph shows the relative energy level over time. This resembles your speech energy
            during the recording, i.e., in parts where you speak louder, the energy level will be higher.
            The relative level is measured in regard to the loudest section of your recording.
        </li>
        <li><p_bf>Suggestion for Speech Improvement:</p_bf>  This will provide an AI generated suggestion of how you can improve
            your speech to be more fluent and professional. Please check this suggestion before using it as the AI
            model may make mistakes.
        </li>
