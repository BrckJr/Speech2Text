        You always wanted to improve your presentation and speaking skills? Then you are at the perfect place!
        Every one of us has to hold a presentation or give a speech from time to time. It can be challenging to train
        that without having friends or family listening to the speech and giving you subjective feedback.
        Of course, this is valuable, but sometimes you just want to practice on your own without the need for
        anyone else to listen carefully and get objective feedback. If so, then you are at the perfect place.

        When it comes to presentations, it is often the pure speech that decides whether
        the content is interesting and capturing for the audience or not. That's why your recording will be analysed
        in terms of the following objective features:
    </p>
    <ol class="analytics-list">
        <li> <p_bf data-i18n="general_info_title">General Information:</p_bf> <span data-i18n="general_info_paragraph">This includes an AI generated headline for your speech, the language of your
            recording as well as the length and word count in your recording.</span>
        </li>
        <li><p_bf data-i18n="summary_title">Summary of the Speech:</p_bf> <span data-i18n="summary_paragraph">AI generated summary of your speech. If the AI model captures the essence
            of your speech, it is also likely that your audience may capture it.</span>
        </li>
        <li><p_bf data-i18n="speech_rate_title">Speech Rate:</p_bf> <span data-i18n="speech_rate_paragraph">The graph shows your speech rate over time for your whole recording. The speech rate
            is measured in words per minute. There are also upper and lower bounds marked in the graph,
            giving you an orientation in which bounds your speech rate should be to avoid being too slow or too fast.</span>
        </li>
        <li><p_bf data-i18n="pitch_analysis_title">Pitch Analysis:</p_bf> <span data-i18n="pitch_analysis_paragraph">The graph shows the pitch you have during your speech. Usually, it is a good sign to have
            high amplitude of your pitch throughout the speech as this means you are varying in your pitch.
            In contrast, boring speeches usually have a small amplitude.</span>
        </li>
        <li><p_bf data-i18n="energy_analysis_title">Energy Analysis:</p_bf> <span data-i18n="energy_analysis_paragraph">The graph shows the relative energy level over time. This resembles your speech energy
            during the recording, i.e., in parts where you speak louder, the energy level will be higher.
            The relative level is measured in regard to the loudest section of your recording.</span>
        </li>
        <li><p_bf data-i18n="speech_improvement_title">Suggestion for Speech Improvement:</p_bf> <span data-i18n="speech_improvement_paragraph">This will provide an AI generated suggestion of how you can improve
            your speech to be more fluent and professional. Please check this suggestion before using it as the AI
            model may make mistakes.</span>

Sustainability isn't just about what we do as individuals, it's also about advocating for policies that support sustainable development. Governments play a key role in shaping our future by supporting renewable energy sources, investing, green infrastructure, and encouraging business to adopt sustainable practices. When we invest in sustainable practices, we create jobs, improve public health, and strengthen the fabric of society. Sustainable living is a win-win. We must ask ourselves, what kind of world do we want to live behind? A world filled with waste and pollution, or world where resources are used wisely, and the planet thrives? ...</p>
