  "intro_paragraph": "You always wanted to improve your presentation and speaking skills? Then you are at the perfect place! Every one of us has to hold a presentation or give a speech from time to time. It can be challenging to train that without having friends or family listening to the speech and giving you subjective feedback. Of course, this is valuable, but sometimes you just want to practice on your own without the need for anyone else to listen carefully and get objective feedback. If so, then you are at the perfect place.",

  "analytics_item_3_heading": "Speech Rate",
  "analytics_item_3_paragraph": "The graph shows your speech rate over time for your whole recording. The speech rate is measured in words per minute.

  "analytics_item_4_heading": "Pitch Analysis",
  "analytics_item_4_paragraph": "The graph shows the pitch you have during your speech. Usually, it is a good sign to have high amplitude of your pitch throughout the speech as this means you are varying in your pitch. In contrast, boring speeches usually have a small amplitude.",
  "analytics_item_5_heading": "Energy Analysis",
  "analytics_item_5_paragraph": "The graph shows the relative energy level over time. This resembles your speech energy during the recording, i.e., in parts where you speak louder, the energy level will be higher. The relative level is measured in regard to the loudest section of your recording.",

Sustainability isn't just about what we do as individuals, it's also about advocating for policies that support sustainable development. Governments play a key role in shaping our future by supporting renewable energy sources, investing, green infrastructure, and encouraging business to adopt sustainable practices. When we invest in sustainable practices, we create jobs, improve public health, and strengthen the fabric of society. Sustainable living is a win-win. We must ask ourselves, what kind of world do we want to leave behind? A world filled with waste and pollution, or a world where resources are used wisely, and the planet thrives?",
